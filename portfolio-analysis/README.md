# Overview

It has been more than a year since I started investing meaningful amounts of my money. Now I want to examine my investing approach more rigorous. 

In particular, I want to explore the allocation of assets in my portfolio (currently all growth stocks and total market ETFs), and look for opportunities to achieve more growth for lower volatility. 

I'm also interested in marketing timing, learning to handle time series data, and understanding core financial concepts.

Hopefully, these investigations will help me to improve my portfolio for my growth goals. And I love that I get to use R to do so. 

**Some of the questions I'm most interested in answering:** 

- What is the expected growth of my portfolio? 
- Could I achieve more growth in my portfolio for the same amount of volatility I currently have? 
- What is the difference between value and growth?
- What is risk, and how risky is my portfolio? What is risk? 
- What is the Sharpe ratio?
